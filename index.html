        The Ultimate Trivia, powered by The Trivia API, puts players in control
        of their experience. Choose categories, questions, and difficulty
        levels, where harder questions earn higher rewards. To win, answer 15
        questions (5 easy, 5 medium, 5 hard) in any order. Classic lifelines
        like 50/50, Ask a Friend, Ask the Audience, and Switch the Question add
        strategy and excitement. Players can quit anytime to secure their
        winnings or risk it all for bigger rewards.
